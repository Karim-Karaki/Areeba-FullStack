# Backend API Documentation

The backend code consists of an Express server connected to a MongoDB database with Mongoose as an ORM. It exposes various RESTful API endpoints for interacting with items and categories.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- npm

## Installation & Running the server

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the terminal in the project directory and install the required packages with `npm install`.
3. Run the server with `npm start` (or by running the `items.js` file).
4. The server will run on `http://localhost:4000`.

## API Endpoints

All requests and responses are in JSON format.

- `POST /categories` - Creates a new category.
  - Request body: `{"name": "<category name>"}`
  - Response: `{"_id": "<id>", "name": "<category name>", "_v": 0}`
  - Error: `{"message": "An error occurred"}`
- `GET /categories` - Retrieves all categories. Response: Array of category objects.
- `DELETE /categories/:id` - Deletes a category with the specified id. Response: "Category deleted"
- `POST /items` - Creates a new item.
  - Request body: `{"name": "<item name>", "category": "<category id>", "description": "<description>", "phone_number": "<phone number>"}`
  - Response: Item object.
  - Error: `{"message": "Invalid Category‚Äù}` or `{"message": "Invalid Number"}`
- `GET /items` - Retrieves all items. Response: Array of item objects.
- `DELETE /items/:id` - Deletes an item with the specified id. Response: "Item deleted"
- `PUT /items/:id` - Updates an item with the specified id.
  - Request body: `{"name": "<item name>", "description": "<description>", "phone_number": "<phone number>", "category": "<category id>"}`
  - Response: "Item updated"
  - Error: `{"message": "Category does not exist"}` or `{"message": "Invalid Number"}`

# Frontend Documentation

The frontend code is built using React and interacts with the backend via the provided API. It allows the user to add, view, and delete items and categories.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- npm

## Installation & Running the application

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the terminal in the project directory and install the required packages with `npm install`.
3. Run the application with `npm start`.
4. The application will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- The user can add a new item by clicking the "Add item" button and filling in the details in the popup form.
- The user can add a new category by clicking the "Add category" button and filling in the details in the popup form.
- The user can view all items and their details on the main page.
- Each item can be updated or deleted by clicking the respective buttons.

# Containerization

An attempt to containerize the project was made using Docker, but both repos had to be merged in a third repo in order to containerize both of them. In the root directory where the backend and frontend and nginx are, run the following:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
